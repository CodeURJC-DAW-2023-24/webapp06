## Images

- Users can have profile pictures and posts can have an image attached to them.

## Graphs

- Users with an account can visualize how many threads they have created each month of the past year, the same can be done with posts.

## Complementary technology

- We will send new users emails to activate their accounts.
- Users that want to change their passwords will be sent a password recovery email.

## Algorithm

- Anonymous users will be shown a list of the most trending threads in the last 2 days.
- For registered users, this list will be filtered to only show threads from forums where they are active.
